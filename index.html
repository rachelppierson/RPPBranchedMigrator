<h1>In development.</h1>

<p>This project is inspired by Sean Chambers' excellent FluentMigrator tool, and is intended to fill in some of the small gaps in that tool. It's being developed as a new project, partly as a result of the different architectural style that's had to be taken to cater for concurrent branches (using a time-based rather than a sequentially-numbered based approach to migration scripts), and partly because I wanted to have the fun and deep understanding of the topic that only really comes from starting from scratch and making mistakes all on your own.</p>
